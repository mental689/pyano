PyANO 2
============

## Introduction
This is the official repository of the automated annotation tool PyANO 2.
With this project, we aim on providing a tool to reduce the cost of building new datasets for computer vision tasks.
The following three activities will be modeled in this project:

* __Collecting videos from video sharing services such as YouTube__: Searching based on text keywords. We rely on external search services such as YouTube.

* __Survey and report tools__: this module provides user tools to ask participants questions in controlled and well-designed experiments. One popular use cases of these tools is to filter further irrelevant videos by asking participants questions.

* __Spatio-temporal annotation tools__: We rely on the popular annotation tool VATIC for this purpose. Annotators will be asked to annotate video frames in with bounding boxes.
